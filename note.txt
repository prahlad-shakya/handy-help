function shuffleGallery() {
Defines a new function named shuffleGallery that will handle the shuffling logic.


const row = document.querySelector('.gallery-wrapper .row');
Selects the <div class="row"> inside the .gallery-wrapper section.

This is the parent container that holds all the .col-lg-4 elements (your images).



const columns = Array.from(row.children);
Gets all child elements of the row div (each .col-lg-4).

row.children returns an HTMLCollection, so we use Array.from() to convert it into a real JavaScript array.

This is necessary so we can shuffle it using array methods.



const shuffled = columns.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);
Randomly sorts the array using the sort() method.

Math.random() - 0.5 produces a number between -0.5 and +0.5, which randomly places each element in the array.

This line effectively shuffles the order of image containers.



row.innerHTML = '';
Clears the original contents of the row div.

This removes all the current image columns from the DOM.



shuffled.forEach(col => row.appendChild(col));
Iterates over the shuffled array.

Re-inserts each .col-lg-4 image container back into the row in the new (shuffled) order.



setInterval(shuffleGallery, 5000);
Automatically calls shuffleGallery() every 5000 milliseconds (i.e. every 5 seconds).

This ensures that the gallery reshuffles continuously.



window.onload = shuffleGallery;
Calls the shuffleGallery() function once when the page first loads.

This gives an initial shuffle before the interval starts.
